                <p>At our sole discretion, ServisHero may offer any of the following free services on the Product, which you may select to use or receive at your option. Certain of the following services may require you to provide additional Personal Data as detailed below:</p>
                <ol start="1">
                    <li><strong>ELECTRONIC NEWSLETTERS</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>We may offer a free electronic newsletter to users. We will gather the email addresses of users who sign up for ServisHero for the newsletter mailing list. Users may remove themselves from this mailing list by opting out of receiving newsletters during the registration process, by following the link provided in each newsletter that points users to a subscription management page where the user can unsubscribe from receiving newsletters or by changing their preferences in their Profile Settings page.</p>
                <ol start="2">
                    <li><strong>&ldquo;SEND TO A FRIEND&rdquo;</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Our Product users can voluntarily choose to electronically forward a link, page, or document to someone else by clicking &ldquo;send to a friend.&rdquo; To do so, the user must provide his or her email address or phone number, as well as the email address or phone number of the recipient. The user&rsquo;s email address and phone number is used only in the case of transmission errors and, of course, to let the recipient know who sent the email. The information is not used for any other purpose.</p>
                <ol start="3">
                    <li><strong>POLLING</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>We may offer interactive polls to users so they can easily share their opinions with other users and see what our audience thinks about important issues, Services, and/or the Product. Opinions or other responses to polls are aggregated and are not identifiable to any particular user. We may use a system to &ldquo;tag&rdquo; users after they have voted, so they can vote only once on a particular question. This tag is not correlated with information about individual users.</p>
                <ol start="4">
                    <li><strong>SURVEYS</strong></li>
                </ol>
                <p>We may conduct user surveys from time to time to better target our content to our Product users. We will not share individual responses from these surveys with any third party. We will share aggregate data with third party service providers, partners, and other third parties. We also will post aggregate data containing survey responses on our Product; that data may be viewed and downloaded by other users of our Product.</p>
                <p class="contentSection"><strong>D. Children&rsquo;s Privacy</strong></p>
                <p>Our Services are not designed for children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with Personal Data, we may delete such information from our systems.</p>
                <p class="contentSection"><strong>E. Security</strong></p>
                <p>We employ procedural and technological security measures, which are reasonably and practically designed to help protect your Personal Data from loss, misuse, modification, unauthorised or accidental access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.. We ensure that confidentiality safeguards have been put in place to ensure your rights to personal data protection remains unaffected. We protect your Personal Data by: (a) restricting access to Personal Data; and (b) maintaining and implementing measures to prevent unauthorised computer access, which includes using encryption, passwords. No security measures, however, are 100% complete. Therefore, we do not promise and cannot guarantee, and thus you should not expect, that your Personal Data or private communications will not be collected and used by others. You should take steps to protect against unauthorized access to your password, phone, and computer by, among other things, signing off after using a shared computer, choosing a robust password that nobody else knows or can easily guess, and keeping your log-in and password private. ServisHero is not responsible for the unauthorized use of your information nor for any lost, stolen, compromised passwords, or for any activity on your Account via unauthorized password activity.</p>
                <p class="contentSection"><strong>F. Disclosure</strong></p>

For example, we may provide your information to a credit card processing company to process your payment. The vendors and service agencies will not receive any right to use your Personal Data beyond what is necessary to perform its obligations to provide the Services to you.

                </ol>
                <p>We may share your Personal Data with other Registered Users to whom you explicitly ask us to send your information or if you explicitly consent to such disclosure upon receipt of a specific Service. For instance, when you contract for a specific Service with another Registered User, ServisHero will send that Registered User a notice that includes the Personal Data that you have chosen to allow ServisHero to reveal to users with whom you contract.</p>
                <p class="contentSection"><strong>G. Links to External Products</strong></p>
                <p>The Product may contain links to other Products or resources over which ServisHero does not have any control. Such links do not constitute an endorsement by ServisHero of those external Products. You acknowledge that ServisHero is providing these links to you only as a convenience, and further agree that ServisHero is not responsible for the content of such external Products.

                <p>Any Personal Data shall not be kept longer than is necessary for the fulfilment of the Purposes as set forth in section B above. ServisHero is committed to take all reasonable steps to ensure that all Personal Data is destroyed or permanently deleted when it is no longer required for the Purposes for which it was to be processed.</p>
                <p class="contentSection"><strong>I. Updating, Deleting and Correcting Your Personal Data</strong></p>
                <p>ServisHero is committed to take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data is accurate, complete, not misleading and kept up-to-date by having regard to the Purposes for which the Personal Data was collected and further processed. Should you made aware of any inaccurate, incomplete and misleading Personal Data or where the Personal Data provided to us earlier have become incorrect and out of date, kindly contact us at<a href="mailto:support@servishero.com">support@servishero.com&nbsp;</a>.</p>
                <p>You may choose to restrict the collection or use of your Personal Data in the following ways:</p>
                <p>You can review, correct and delete your Personal Data by logging into the Product and navigating to your preferences page in &ldquo;Your Profile&rdquo; (or similar screen/page). You must promptly update your Personal Data if it changes or is inaccurate. Typically, we will not manually alter your Personal Data because it is very difficult to verify your identity remotely. Nonetheless, upon your request we will close your Account and remove your Personal Data from view as soon as reasonably possible, based on your Account activity and in accordance with applicable law. We do retain information from closed Accounts in order to comply with the law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations of any Registered User, enforce our Terms of Use, and take any other actions otherwise permitted by law that we deem necessary in our sole and absolute discretion. You should understand, however, that once you publicly post a Request, Offer, Want, Feedback, or any other information onto the Product, you may not be able to change or remove it. Once we have deleted or removed your Account, you agree that ServisHero shall not be responsible for any Personal Data that was not included within your deleted and/or removed Account that remains on the Product.</p>
                <p class="contentSection"><strong>J. What Choices Do I Have Regarding Use of My Personal Data?</strong></p>
                <p>We may send periodic promotional or informational emails to you. You may opt-out of such communications by following the opt-out instructions contained in the email. Please note that it may take up to 10 business days for us to process opt-out requests. If you opt-out of receiving emails about recommendations or other information we think may interest you, we may still send you emails about your Account or any Services you have requested or received from us.</p>
                <p class="contentSection"><strong>K. Third-Party Ad Networks</strong></p>
                <p>We participate in third party ad networks that may display advertisements on other Products based on your visits to our Site as well as other Products.

If you book a service with a Registered User, cancel a scheduled service with a Registered User, receive an offer on your posted service from a Registered User, or have posted a service, ServisHero may send a notice to you or the appropriate Registered User that includes your Full Name. Thus, if you associate your real name with your Full Name, the people to whom you have revealed your name may be able to personally identify your Product activities.</p>

Please respect the privacy of others. You agree to use the information of other users solely for the following purposes: (a) ServisHero-transaction-related purposes; and (b) using Services offered through the Product.</p>
